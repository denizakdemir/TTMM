# Tabular Transformer (TTML) Package Evaluation

## Overview

This document summarizes the evaluation of the TTML package, including tests run, issues found, and fixes applied.

## Tests Performed

- Installed the package in development mode with all optional dependencies
- Tested the demo script `demo.py` which builds and trains a model on the California housing dataset
- Tested the explainability demo `explainability_demo.py`
- Verified that basic model configurations work correctly
- Checked the implementation of the transformer architecture, task heads, and inference logic

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Parameter naming inconsistency**:
   - In the `Trainer` class, the parameter was named `task_head` (singular), but in some examples and other functions, it was referred to as `task_heads` (plural)
   - This was a critical inconsistency that caused runtime errors
   - Fixed this inconsistency in:
     - `tabular_transformer/examples/explainability_demo.py`
     - `tabular_transformer/examples/demo.py`
     - `tabular_transformer/inference/predict.py`
     - All notebook examples
     - README.md examples

2. **Missing dependency for some examples**:
   - The `load_support` function from `lifelines.datasets` was imported but doesn't exist in the current version
   - Added a synthetic implementation of this function in `data_utils.py` to make examples work

3. **Notebook format issue**:
   - Some notebook cells had missing required properties for execution
   - This would need a full rewrite of the notebook with proper Jupyter notebook format 

## Successful Tests

- The main demo script ran successfully and trained a model on the California housing dataset
- The explainability demo ran successfully, generating various visualizations and reports
- The package shows promising functionality for:
  - Classification
  - Regression
  - Handling categorical and numerical data
  - Explainability tools

## Recommendations

1. **API Consistency**:
   - Review and standardize parameter names across the codebase
   - Ensure documentation matches implementation

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Include comprehensive requirements list and version constraints
   - Test with different versions of key dependencies (PyTorch, etc.)
   - Consider containerizing examples for reproducibility

3. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Add more comments in complex sections of the code
   - Create high-level architecture documentation
   - Include troubleshooting guide

4. **Testing Framework**:
   - Implement comprehensive unit tests
   - Add integration tests for the complete workflow
   - Create CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Conclusion

The TTML package provides a solid implementation of a transformer-based model for tabular data with support for various tasks and explainability tools. With the fixes applied, the main functionality works as expected. The package demonstrates high potential for tabular data modeling tasks, particularly in settings where multi-task learning and interpretability are important.
